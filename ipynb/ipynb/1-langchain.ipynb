In 3000 years of our history people from all over the world have come and invaded us, captured our lands, conquered our minds. From Alexander onwards the Greeks, the Turks, the Moguls, the Portuguese, the British, the French, the Dutch, all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. Yet we have not done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture and their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them. Why? Because we respect the freedom of others. That is why my FIRST VISION is that of FREEDOM. I believe that India got its first vision of this in 1857, when we started the war of Independence. It is this freedom that we must protect and nurture and build on. If we are not free, no one will respect us.\\n\\nWe have 10 percent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling. Our achievements are being globally recognised today. Yet we lack the self-confidence to see ourselves as a developed nation, self-reliant and self-assured. Isn’t this incorrect? MY SECOND VISION for India is DEVELOPMENT. For fifty years we have been a developing nation. It is time we see ourselves as a developed nation. We are among top five nations in the world in terms of GDP.\\n\\nI have a THIRD VISION. India must stand up to the world. Because I believe that unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Only strength respects strength. We must be strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must go hand-in-hand. My good fortune was to have worked with three great minds. Dr.Vikram Sarabhai, of the Dept. of Space, Professor Satish Dhawan, who succeeded him and Dr. Brahm Prakash, father of nuclear material. I was lucky to have worked with all three of them closely and consider this the great opportunity of my life.\\n\\nI was in Hyderabad giving this lecture, when a 14 year-old girl asked me for my autograph. I asked her what her goal in life is. She replied: I want to live in a developed India. For her, you and I will have to build this developed India. You must proclaim India is not an underdeveloped nation; it is a highly developed nation.\\n\\nYou say that our government is inefficient. You say that our laws are too old. You say that the municipality does not pick up the garbage. You say that the phones don’t work, the railways are a joke, the airline is the worst in the world, and mails never reach their destination. You say that our country has been fed to the dogs and is the absolute pits. You say, say and say. What do you do about it?\\n\\nDear Indians, I am echoing J.F.Kennedy’s words to his fellow Americans to relate to Indians ……. “ASK WHAT WE CAN DO FOR INDIA AND DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE TO MAKE INDIA WHAT AMERICA AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE TODAY.”\")]"

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9.

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Before this, Go was considered to be an intractable game for computers to master, as its simple rules lay out an exponential number of variations in the board positions, many more than what in Chess. This event surely highlighted 2016 as a big year for AI. Because of AlphaGo, much attention has been attracted to the progress of AI.\\nMeanwhile, many companies are spending resources on pushing the edges of AI applications, that indeed have the potential to change or even revolutionize how we are gonna live. Familiar examples include self-driving cars, chatbots, home assistant devices and many others. One of the secret receipts behind the progress we have had in recent years is deep learning.\\nWhy Does Deep Learning Work Now?#\\nDeep learning models, in simple words, are large and deep artificial neural nets. A neural network (“NN”) can be well presented in a directed acyclic graph: the input layer takes in signal vectors; one or multiple hidden layers process the outputs of the previous layer. The initial concept of a neural network can be traced back to more than half a century ago. But why does it work now? Why do people start talking about them all of a sudden?\\n\\n\\nA three-layer artificial neural network. (Image source: http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#conv)\\n\\nThe reason is surprisingly simple:\\n\\nWe have a lot more data.\\nWe have much powerful computers.\\n\\nA large and deep neural network has many more layers + many more nodes in each layer, which results in exponentially many more parameters to tune. Without enough data, we cannot learn parameters efficiently. Without powerful computers, learning would be too slow and insufficient.\\nHere is an interesting plot presenting the relationship between the data scale and the model performance, proposed by Andrew Ng in his “Nuts and Bolts of Applying Deep Learning” talk. On a small dataset, traditional algorithms (Regression, Random Forests, SVM, GBM, etc.) or statistical learning does a great job, but once the data scale goes up to the sky, the large NN outperforms others. Partially because compared to a traditional ML model, a neural network model has many more parameters and has the capability to learn complicated nonlinear patterns. Thus we expect the model to pick the most helpful features by itself without too much expert-involved manual feature engineering.\\n\\n\\nThe data scale versus the model performance. (Recreated based on: https://youtu.be/F1ka6a13S9I)\\n\\nDeep Learning Models#\\nNext, let’s go through a few classical deep learning models.\\nConvolutional Neural Network#\\nConvolutional neural networks, short for “CNN”, is a type of feed-forward artificial neural networks, in which the connectivity pattern between its neurons is inspired by the organization of the visual cortex system. The primary visual cortex (V1) does edge detection out of the raw visual input from the retina. The secondary visual cortex (V2), also called prestriate cortex, receives the edge features from V1 and extracts simple visual properties such as orientation, spatial frequency, and color. The visual area V4 handles more complicated object attributes. All the processed visual features flow into the final logic unit, inferior temporal gyrus (IT), for object recognition. The shortcut between V1 and V4 inspires a special type of CNN with connections between non-adjacent layers: Residual Net (He, et al. 2016) containing “Residual Block” which supports some input of one layer to be passed to the component two layers later.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the human visual cortex system. (Image source: Wang & Raj 2017)\\n\\nConvolution is a mathematical term, here referring to an operation between two matrices. The convolutional layer has a fixed small matrix defined, also called kernel or filter. As the kernel is sliding, or convolving, across the matrix representation of the input image, it is computing the element-wise multiplication of the values in the kernel matrix and the original image values. Specially designed kernels can process images for common purposes like blurring, sharpening, edge detection and many others, fast and efficiently.\\n\\n\\nThe LeNet architecture consists of two sets of convolutional, activation, and pooling layers, followed by a fully-connected layer, activation, another fully-connected layer, and finally a softmax classifier (Image source: http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html)\\n\\nConvolutional and pooling (or “sub-sampling” in Fig. 4) layers act like the V1, V2 and V4 visual cortex units, responding to feature extraction. The object recognition reasoning happens in the later fully-connected layers which consume the extracted features.\\nRecurrent Neural Network#\\nA sequence model is usually designed to transform an input sequence into an output sequence that lives in a different domain. Recurrent neural network, short for “RNN”, is suitable for this purpose and has shown tremendous improvement in problems like handwriting recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation (Sutskever et al. 2011, Liwicki et al. 2007).\\nA recurrent neural network model is born with the capability to process long sequential data and to tackle tasks with context spreading in time. The model processes one element in the sequence at one time step. After computation, the newly updated unit state is passed down to the next time step to facilitate the computation of the next element. Imagine the case when an RNN model reads all the Wikipedia articles, character by character, and then it can predict the following words given the context.\\n\\n\\nA recurrent neural network with one hidden unit (left) and its unrolling version in time (right). The unrolling version illustrates what happens in time: $s\\\\_{t-1}$, $s\\\\_{t}$, and $s\\\\_{t+1}$ are the same unit with different states at different time steps $t-1$, $t$, and $t+1$. (Image source: LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton, 2015; Fig. 5)\\n\\nHowever, simple perceptron neurons that linearly combine the current input element and the last unit state may easily lose the long-term dependencies. For example, we start a sentence with “Alice is working at …” and later after a whole paragraph, we want to start the next sentence with “She” or “He” correctly. If the model forgets the character’s name “Alice”, we can never know. To resolve the issue, researchers created a special neuron with a much more complicated internal structure for memorizing long-term context, named “Long-short term memory (LSTM)” cell. It is smart enough to learn for how long it should memorize the old information, when to forget, when to make use of the new data, and how to combine the old memory with new input. This introduction is so well written that I recommend everyone with interest in LSTM to read it. It has been officially promoted in the Tensorflow documentation ;-)\\n\\n\\nThe structure of a LSTM cell. (Image source: http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs)\\n\\nTo demonstrate the power of RNNs, Andrej Karpathy built a character-based language model using RNN with LSTM cells.  Without knowing any English vocabulary beforehand, the model could learn the relationship between characters to form words and then the relationship between words to form sentences. It could achieve a decent performance even without a huge set of training data.\\n\\n\\nA character-based recurrent neural network model writes like a Shakespeare. (Image source: http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness)\\n\\nRNN: Sequence-to-Sequence Model#\\nThe sequence-to-sequence model is an extended version of RNN, but its application field is distinguishable enough that I would like to list it in a separated section. Same as RNN, a sequence-to-sequence model operates on sequential data, but particularly it is commonly used to develop chatbots or personal assistants, both generating meaningful response for input questions. A sequence-to-sequence model consists of two RNNs, encoder and decoder. The encoder learns the contextual information from the input words and then hands over the knowledge to the decoder side through a “context vector” (or “thought vector”, as shown in Fig 8.). Finally, the decoder consumes the context vector and generates proper responses.\\n\\n\\nA sequence-to-sequence model for generating Gmail auto replies. (Image source: https://research.googleblog.com/2015/11/computer-respond-to-this-email.html)\\n\\nAutoencoders#\\nDifferent from the previous models, autoencoders are for unsupervised learning. It is designed to learn a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional data set, similar to what Principal Components Analysis (PCA) does. The autoencoder model tries to learn an approximation function $ f(x) \\\\approx x $ to reproduce the input data. However, it is restricted by a bottleneck layer in the middle with a very small number of nodes. With limited capacity, the model is forced to form a very efficient encoding of the data, that is essentially the low-dimensional code we learned.\\n\\n\\nAn autoencoder model has a bottleneck layer with only a few neurons. (Image source: Geoffrey Hinton’s Coursera class \"Neural Networks for Machine Learning\" - Week 15)\\n\\nHinton and Salakhutdinov used autoencoders to compress documents on a variety of topics. As shown in Fig 10, when both PCA and autoencoder were applied to reduce the documents onto two dimensions, autoencoder demonstrated a much better outcome. With the help of autoencoder, we can do efficient data compression to speed up the information retrieval including both documents and images.\\n\\n\\nThe outputs of PCA (left) and autoencoder (right) when both try to compress documents into two numbers. (Image source: Hinton & Salakhutdinov 2006)\\n\\nReinforcement (Deep) Learning#\\nSince I started my post with AlphaGo, let us dig a bit more on why AlphaGo worked out. Reinforcement learning (“RL”) is one of the secrets behind its success. RL is a subfield of machine learning which allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the optimal behavior within a given context, with a goal to maximize the long-term performance measured by a given metric.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlphaGo neural network training pipeline and architecture. (Image source: Silver et al. 2016)\\n\\nThe AlphaGo system starts with a supervised learning process to train a fast rollout policy and a policy network, relying on the manually curated training dataset of professional players’ games. It learns what is the best strategy given the current position on the game board. Then it applies reinforcement learning by setting up self-play games. The RL policy network gets improved when it wins more and more games against previous versions of the policy network. In the self-play stage, AlphaGo becomes stronger and stronger by playing against itself without requiring additional external training data.\\nGenerative Adversarial Network#\\nGenerative adversarial network, short for “GAN”, is a type of deep generative models. GAN is able to create new examples after learning through the real data.  It is consist of two models competing against each other in a zero-sum game framework. The famous deep learning researcher Yann LeCun gave it a super high praise: Generative Adversarial Network is the most interesting idea in the last ten years in machine learning. (See the Quora question: “What are some recent and potentially upcoming breakthroughs in deep learning?”)\\n\\n\\nThe architecture of a generative adversarial network. (Image source: http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/01/generative-adversarial-networks-hot-topic-machine-learning.html)\\n\\nIn the original GAN paper, GAN was proposed to generate meaningful images after learning from real photos. It comprises two independent models: the Generator and the Discriminator. The generator produces fake images and sends the output to the discriminator model. The discriminator works like a judge, as it is optimized for identifying the real photos from the fake ones. The generator model is trying hard to cheat the discriminator while the judge is trying hard not to be cheated. This interesting zero-sum game between these two models motivates both to develop their designed skills and improve their functionalities. Eventually, we take the generator model for producing new images.\\nToolkits and Libraries#\\nAfter learning all these models, you may start wondering how you can implement the models and use them for real. Fortunately, we have many open source toolkits and libraries for building deep learning models. Tensorflow is fairly new but has attracted a lot of popularity. It turns out, TensorFlow was the most forked Github project of 2015. All that happened in a period of 2 months after its release in Nov 2015.\\n\\n\\nHow to Learn?#\\nIf you are very new to the field and willing to devote some time to studying deep learning in a more systematic way, I would recommend you to start with the book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. The Coursera course “Neural Networks for Machine Learning” by Geoffrey Hinton (Godfather of deep learning!). The content for the course was prepared around 2006, pretty old, but it helps you build up a solid foundation for understanding deep learning models and expedite further exploration.\\nMeanwhile, maintain your curiosity and passion. The field is making progress every day. Even classical or widely adopted deep learning models may just have been proposed 1-2 years ago. Reading academic papers can help you learn stuff in depth and keep up with the cutting-edge findings.\\nUseful resources#\\n\\nGoogle Scholar: http://scholar.google.com\\narXiv cs section: https://arxiv.org/list/cs/recent\\nUnsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning Tutorial\\nTensorflow Tutorials\\nData Science Weekly\\nKDnuggets\\nTons of blog posts and online tutorials\\nRelated Cousera courses\\nawesome-deep-learning-papers\\n\\nBlog posts mentioned#\\n\\nExplained Visually: Image Kernels\\nUnderstanding LSTM Networks\\nThe Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks\\nComputer, respond to this email.\\n\\nInteresting blogs worthy of checking#\\n\\nwww.wildml.com\\ncolah.github.io\\nkarpathy.github.io\\nblog.openai.com\\n\\nPapers mentioned#\\n[1] He, Kaiming, et al. “Deep residual learning for image recognition.” Proc.
